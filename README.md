Machine learning proves immensely helpful in many industries in automating tasks that earlier required human labor one such application of ML is predicting whether a particular trade will be profitable or not.

In this article, we will learn how to predict a signal that indicates whether buying a particular stock will be helpful or not by using ML.

Let’s start by importing some libraries which will be used for various purposes which will be explained later in this article.

Importing Libraries
Python libraries make it very easy for us to handle the data and perform typical and complex tasks with a single line of code.

Pandas – This library helps to load the data frame in a 2D array format and has multiple functions to perform analysis tasks in one go.
Numpy – Numpy arrays are very fast and can perform large computations in a very short time.
Matplotlib/Seaborn – This library is used to draw visualizations.
Sklearn – This module contains multiple libraries having pre-implemented functions to perform tasks from data preprocessing to model development and evaluation.
XGBoost – This contains the eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm which is one of the algorithms which helps us to achieve high accuracy on predictions.
